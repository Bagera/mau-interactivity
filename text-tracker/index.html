        <h1>Faceless Interaction</h1>
        <p>
          In the middle of the present struggle to keep interaction complexity
          in check, as artifact complexity continues to rise and the technical
          possibilities to interact multiply, the notion of interface is
          scrutinized. First, a limited number of previous interpretations or
          thought styles of the notion are identified and discussed. This serves
          as a framework for an analysis of the current situation with regard to
          complexity, control, and interaction, leading to a realization of the
          crucial role of surface in contemporary understanding of interaction.
          The potential of faceless interaction, interaction that transcends
          traditional reliance on surfaces, is then examined and discussed,
          liberating possibilities as well as complicating effects, and dangers
          are pointed out, ending with a sketch of a possibly emerging new
          thought style
